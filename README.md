# Project-Algorithmic-Stock-Trading-Program
This whole project would simulate the real stock market trading by using historical stock market performance data for both Apple and Microsoft.

Milestone I includes two functions: The test_data function would return a specific number by using the filename, columns, and days users provide. The transact function would simulate the buy and sell stocks actions. It would raise exception if the funds or stocks are not enough, or the user does not indicate the program to sell or buy.
